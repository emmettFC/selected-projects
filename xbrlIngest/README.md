### Project Overview: 
In 2015 I was working for the applied analytics group at AlixPartners, a consulting firm based in NYC. For the annual company meeting, employees were offered the chance to compete in a data science competition, which asked participants to respond to one of three promts. Once of these prompts challenegd participants to develop a tool to predict EBITDA, as a component meant to improve the functionality of the Early Warning Model tool, which was used to identify distressed companies / potential clientele for the restructuring arm of the company.
