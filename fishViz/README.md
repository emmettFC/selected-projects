# fishViz
## Research and application of methods to video collection & analysis in variable low-light limnological contexts

### Topics included in this project repository: 
1. Computer vision:
  * Motion detection in openCv 
  * Background removal for 'empty' frame initialization via applied regular singular value decomposition
  * Object detection in tensorflow
  * Applied feature extraction and convolutional neural network via SSD Mobile Net algorithm 

2. Automated annotation: 
  * Implementing new method for automating annotations - generating xml labels via bounding rectangles

3. Remote sensing: 
  * Two underwater camera sensors built with Raspberry Pi's
  * Implementation of light-weight motion detection on Raspbian image
  * One humidity/temperature sensor built with Arduino Uno (not deployed) 
  * One humidity/temperature sensor built with Arduino Yun (not deployed) 
 

### Project Overview: 
Philadelphia's Wissahickon Creek is one of its 7 major subwatersheds and drains into the Schuylkill river. The creek is known to be very dirty, swimming is prohibited but many do so despite the prohibition. It is also an attractive destination for anglers due to the variety and density of its fish population. The creek is stocked with adult trout twice each year. I am a frequent and somewhat zealous snorkler of the creek, which has dense pockets of fish with (occasionally) high visibility. I identified two adjacent sections of the creek, each less than 300 yards long, which -- with the exception of short periods following very heavy rainfall -- are separated by rockbeds where the water level is < 3 inches deep.
