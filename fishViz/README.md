# fishViz
## Research and application of methods to video collection & analysis in variable low-light limnological contexts

### Topics included in this project repository: 
1. Computer vision:
  * Motion detection in openCv 
  * Background removal for 'empty' frame initialization via applied regular singular value decomposition
  * Object detection in tensorflow
  * Applied feature extraction and convolutional neural network via SSD Mobile Net algorithm 

2. Automated annotation: 
  * Implementing new method for automating annotations - generating xml labels via bounding rectangles

3. Remote sensing: 
  * Two underwater camera sensors built with Raspberry Pi's
  * Implementation of light-weight motion detection on Raspbian image
  * One humidity/temperature sensor built with Arduino Uno (not deployed) 
  * One humidity/temperature sensor built with Arduino Yun (not deployed)
