### Methodolody & Contribution: 


### Summary of Data & Comparison to Previous Study: 

This study will replicate the methodology section of an existing paper that sought to do a demographic analysis of individuals on public sex offender registries (citation below). From a methods standpoint, the contibution of our project will be towards the generalization of methods for gathering SOF data from the public registries.

Who are the people in your neighborhood? A descriptive analysis of individuals on publix sex offender registries.

```

While the analytical goals of this project are different from those of the existing paper, the database we seek to build is nearly identical. This is helpful in that it provides an explicit point of comparison to sanity check the results from each individual scraping process. The two high-level aggregate summaires provided in the existing paper will provide the reference point going forward (pictured below)
