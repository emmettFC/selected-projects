# Analytical regionalization & land use classification:
## Using social media data to map land use in homogenous urban centers

### Introduction

Social media check-in data can be used to classify land use over scenes with homogenous land cover (Frias Martinez 2015). Even in the absence of semantic analysis, geo-tagged social media check-ins provide insight into where people are within the city at a given point in time. This repository contains code and results from an effort to perform land use classification using social media geo-point data. The intention is to develop a model that takes discrete point data and outputs polygons which can be classified by thier land use. There are three major components to this analysis: 

#### 1) Build polygons from discrete geo-points (analytical regionalization)
	
#### 2) Classify polygons by aggregate activity vectors 

#### 3) Develop reliable annotations to evaluate model performance 

The purpose of this repository is to compare the performance of different methodological strategies, and ultimately optimize a land use classification model for Beijing.

### Summary of Data & Comparison to Previous Study: 

This study will replicate the methodology section of an existing paper that sought to do a demographic analysis of individuals on public sex offender registries (citation below). From a methods standpoint, the contibution of our project will be towards the generalization of methods for gathering SOF data from the public registries.

While the analytical goals of this project are different from those of the existing paper, the database we seek to build is nearly identical. This is helpful in that it provides an explicit point of comparison to sanity check the results from each individual scraping process. The two high-level aggregate summaires provided in the existing paper will provide the reference point going forward (pictured below)
