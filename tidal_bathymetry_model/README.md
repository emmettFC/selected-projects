 ## Part I: Review of applied methods for WV2 images of South Water Cay Marine Preserve, Belize 

### Introduction 

Methods for bathymetric modeling of oceanic and fluvial sites is a well studied probelm with an extensive literature. That said, with the energence of UAV technology and improvements in satelite remote sensing imagery, this is an area of research that is fertile for the development of new methods from computer science and specifically the use of deep networks. The intent of this project was to leverage low cost UAV imagery, with flights at regular intervals through the tidal cycle, to try and train a model to do high resolution bathymetric modeling of a coastal tidal inlet in the long island sound. Ultimately, weather and the slow pace of feild work trial and error prevented this experiment from being completed at this time. This repositiory will therefore have two components: 1) breif review of trial application of known bathymetric methods to a set of WV2 imagery covering the South Cay Marine Preserve in Belze, and 2) a discussion of the experimental design, proposed model and preliminary analysis from the first pass at UAV bathymetric modeling of a the intended coastal scene on the long island sound. 

### The South Cay Marine Preserve, Belize

I worked with a doctoral student at UCSB on a project seeking to build a high resolution bathymetric model of the South Cay Marine Preserve in Belize. The purpose of this project was to use passive depth sounding data as labels to train the Stumpf and Lyzenga equations for bathymetric estimates. This is a meaningful effort because while LiDAR bathymetry is highly accurate, it is prohibitively expensive in many applications and a significant proportion of large and ecologically important coastal regions have yet to be mapped with this technology. If we could show that passive low cost depth sounding data could be used to effectively calibrate bathymetric models, then we could provide good topographic maps of these unmapped regions. The spectral data for the region of interest are a set of images from the WV2 digital globe satelite. The image below (left) shows the coverage of the WV2 imagery in red, and the minimal bounding box for the passive depth sounding labels in blue. The lefthand figure is a true color map from the WV2 image of the entire South Cay preserve, with the red showing the enitre region and the green boundary indicating a no-take zone:

The labeled region is quite small compared to the overall scene, though the real challenge comes from the sparse coverage of labeled points within the smaller region. These labels are passively generated from a hand held depth sounding device onboard a research ship studying the patch reef ecosystem of the South Cay. The coverage within the region is pictured below:

To generate bathymetric estimates based on these data, the depth sounding labels have to be intersected with the satellite raster data, such that the spectral values for each band at a given pixel are associated with the depth measurement at that point. Once the spectral data are corrected for atmospheric effects and sun glint, according to the specifications of the satelittle product, then the model coeficients can be calibrated using regression analysis. The 8 bands from the WV2 image data are pictured below for the region of interest :

### Stumpf and Lyzenga bathymetric estimation models

In this iteration of the analysis we chose to employ two well known methods for using multispectral data to estimate bathymetric models: Stumpf (2003) and Lyzenga (1978). The general for of these equations is given below for Lyzenga (equation 1) and Stumpf (equation 2):

Both of these techniques take advantage of the physical nature of lightâ€™s attenuation in the water column, namely that shorter wavelength bands attenuate faster than longer wavelength bands. This relationship is therefore correlated with depth. The first equation, the Lyzenga method, is more labor intesive from a annotation standpoint, given that it makes predictions based not only on the relationship bewtween band ratios and depth, but also the reflectance properties of different types of substrate (ex sand, seagrass, rock etc). In equation 1 above, Li is the TOA radiance value for band i, Lj is the TOA radiance value for band j, Ki/Kj are the light attenuation coeficients for band i and j respectively. 

We applied the Stumpf ratio method for bathymetric estimation according to Ehes & Rooney (2015). Before running the regressions to generate calibration coeficients, we had to convert the raw digital numbers to top of atomosphere spectral radiance values. In order to do this, you need the bandwidth and absolute clibaration factors from the imaging product speficiations for each band. Once this is done, you can apply the Stumpf method given in equation 2 above to generate coeficients and asses model performance. Linear models were trained and run for two subsets of the raw data: 

    1)	For all data <= 30 meters 
    2)	For all data <= 15 meters

For the 30-meter subset, we found an absolute mean difference between the predicted and actual values of 4.15 meters, with R2 of .5411 and RMSE of 3.655 meters. For the 15-meter subset, we found an absolute mean difference of .98 meters, with R2 of .5859 and RMSE of 1.91 meters. The graph below shows the OLS best-fit lines for each implementation:

The 15 meter subset performs pretty well considering the simplicity of the model applied. Clearly though some nonlinear function of the data would perform better given the output shown above. Utlimately though, the model trained on the labeled subset of data can be extrapolated to the entire region for depth < 15 meters and a bathymetric model can be generated. The model produced by this analysis is pictured below:
